	(gdb) run [arg1 arg2 ...]

2. We can set break point for certain condition using the following command syntax
	break <line#> if <condition>

3. We can run the program line by line after a break by simply typing one of the following commands
	(gdb) next
	(gdb) n
	(gdb) ni

4. We can run the function line by line by simply typing one of the following commands
	(gdb) step
	(gdb) s
	(gdb) si

5. We can continue running the program after a breakpoint by simply typing one of the following commands
	(gdb) continue
	(gdb) c
	(gdb) ci

6. We can continue running the program till the end of a function by simply typing the following command
	(gdb) finish

7. We can see the value of variable just once by executing the following command
	(gdb) print <variable-name>

8. We can use the following command syntax to track the value of variable after every break
	(gdb) display <variable-name>

9. We can print the names and values of all the variables in a function using the following command
	info locals

10. We can print the names of the functions used in the program using the following command
